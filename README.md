Hi. I`m Oleh and for a long period of time I was searching for a good physics engine to make my best 3d video game. As far i tried ODE, Bullet and so on, it was hardly to make dempfers, springs and correct programeble animations. The main idea of my game was to make fully interactive sworrd battle game and it came to me this is just imposible to do this wih the existing tools.
So I began to write my oun.

Spring Physics Engine or simply SpringPhE â€” it will be complicated tool writen on c++ and python with huge abilitis to variant physics simulations and programeble anymations. 
Curent moment I`m trying to test and integrate it with Blender 3D as addon and Panda3d as scrypt.
Free sky for all of you, guys and girls! Spring is coming after winter!
